Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them. This project uses logistic regression with feature scaling and principal component analysis to predict customer churn from a sample telco data .csv file.
